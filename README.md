&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Software Technologies” course provides the first steps in 4 technologies:

•  Web development with PHP - introduction to XAMPP, PHP 7, MySQL, Doctrine and Symfony 

•	 Web development with JavaScript - introduction to ES6, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB 

•	 Web development with C# - introduction to C# 6, Entity Framework, ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course is very introductory and its ultimate goal is to help us to choose the right programming language for us. The most important part of the course is the final group project, which also determines our final grade. Оur project was an Animal shelter site written on CSharp with ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework.
